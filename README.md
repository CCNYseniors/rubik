Here is a summary of our project along with a diagram:  
3 by 3 by 3 Rubik's cubes are hard to solve for most people! What if there was a way to make it easier?  Using quantum superposition in our project, users can shift the placement of pieces. In this unique feature, users can shift the placement of any 2 center pieces with each other OR any 2 corner pieces with each other. Since qubits are probabilistic, switches aren't guaranteed. Using gates, however, we can shift probabilities toward our favor! Using this program, anyone who puts in enough effort will be able to solve the cube.
